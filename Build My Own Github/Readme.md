## ðŸ“Œ About

This project demonstrates how to **set up a self-hosted Git server** using an AWS EC2 instance. It covers everything from installing Git, enabling SSH access for developers, pushing and pulling code, and even providing a web-based UI using GitWeb.

## ðŸ“– Quick Q&A

**1. What is a Git Server?**  
A Git server is a machine where Git repositories are hosted so that developers can push and pull code remotely.

**2. How to create your own Git server on AWS?**  
Use an AWS EC2 instance, install Git, add a user named `git`, and create a bare repository in `/var/lib/git`.

**3. SSH key support for secure developer collaboration?**  
Each developer adds their public SSH key to the Git server's `authorized_keys` file, allowing secure access.

**4. Pushing and pulling code from multiple machines?**  
Clone the repo using SSH from any machine, and use `git push` or `git pull` to sync changes.

**5. Setting up a Git Web UI?**  
Install GitWeb, configure the Git root directory, and serve it on a custom port like `1234`.

**6. How does Git store files internally?**  
Git stores files as compressed blobs in the `.git/objects` directory using unique SHA-1 hashes.
