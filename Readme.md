# 🛠️ Build-My-Own-X

Welcome to **Build-My-Own-X** – a personal engineering challenge where I attempt to build and understand real-world software systems by recreating them from scratch. Think of this as a hands-on, deep-dive study into how things work under the hood.

## 🚀 Why?

Rebuilding well-known systems is one of the best ways to:

- Deeply understand their internals
- Practice systems design and architecture
- Explore trade-offs in technology choices
- Grow as a full-stack or systems engineer
