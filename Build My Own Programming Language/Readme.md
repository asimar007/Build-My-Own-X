# My Programming Language

This project is an implementation of a custom programming language, built from the ground up. It includes core components for lexical analysis, parsing, code generation, and execution.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several JavaScript files, each responsible for a specific phase of the language processing:

- `lexer.js`: Handles the lexical analysis (tokenization) of the source code, breaking it down into a stream of tokens.

- `parser.js`: Parses the token stream generated by the lexer, constructing an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) that represents the program's structure.

- `compiler.js`: Orchestrates the overall compilation process, likely connecting the lexer, parser, and code generator.

- `code_generator.js`: Responsible for transforming the AST into executable code (e.g., bytecode, machine code, or an intermediate representation).
s
- `runner.js`: Executes the generated code.

- `main.js`: The entry point of the application, which likely ties all the components together to process and run a program written in your language.

## How to Run

To run a program written in this language:

1. Execute your program using `main.js` (assuming `main.js` is the entry point).

```
node main.js
```
